## Reflection on GPS 1.1

* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

    I wasn’t really struggling with concepts, but it was very different dealing with them in a work type environment. When you weren’t just following instructions and had somebody else doing it with you. It is easier to forget steps, mistype commands and forget concepts.

* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
    
    Usually when working with others on a repositoriy you do not fork it to your repo. Everybody works from the main repository and you share permissions.

* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

    I understood the abstract concepts of driver and navigator, but still found it hard to define those roles and stick with them when actually pairing. I had to ask for clarification on what each person was doing.
    
* **What still confuses you about Git?**

    At the time, we could not figure out the syntax for git fetch and git merge. Afterword I was able to figure out the general concept and proper syntax.
 
* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

    Good. My skills need work. I had a problem with my computer and did not have a planned backup which is not good and negatively impacted my pair’s time. I need to be more prepared. Moving forward I need to be more aware of what the roles of driver and navigator are. I can already tell that feedback is going to be hard. Otherwise I thought it went really well, we were able to work through the problems.
